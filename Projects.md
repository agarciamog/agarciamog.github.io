#### Angular Tour of Heroes
Angular is a popular Javascript framework by Google for building web applications. With Angular and TypeScript (a Javascript superset), developers are able to write object oriented web applications with ease. In Angular Tour of Heroes I built an Angular application that demos modules, components, two-way databinding, event handling, templates, in-memory API, decorators, promises, and routing from Angular's Tutorial. The application allows users to select and edit heroes, while navigating through views using Angular Routes. You can view the source code to the project [here](https://github.com/agarciamog/angular-tour-of-heroes/tree/master/src/app).

#### inContact Custom Dashboard
The dashboard is a demo of inContact's RESTful API and various jQuery concepts like DOM traversal/manupilation, listening for DOM Events, Ajax, $.each, prototyping, and more. It's not likely that you have a login to inContact's platform, so I've provided some screenshots of the dashboard updating with realtime data in 3 second intervals. The dashboard displays current contacts (phone calls, email, chats) that agents in a contact center are on. The timestamp at the bottom updates with the rest of the dashboard. You'll notice that these screenshots are taken more than 3 seconds apart in order to demonstrate dynamic list update. You can view the source code to the project [here](https://github.com/agarciamog/incontact-dashboard).
