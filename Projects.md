#### inContact Custom Dashboard
The dashboard is a demo of inContact's API and various jQuery concepts like DOM traversal/manupilation, listening for DOM Events, Ajax, $.each, prototyping, and more. It's not likely that you have a login to inContact's platform, so I've provided some screenshots of the dashboard updating with realtime data in 3 second intervals. The dashboard displays current contacts (phone calls, email, chats) that agents in a contact center are on. The timestamp at the bottom updates with the rest of the dashboard. You'll notice that these screenshots are taken more than 3 seconds apart in order to demonstrate dynamic list update. You can view the source code to the project [here](https://github.com/agarciamog/incontact-dashboard).

[Login to the Dashboard](https://agarciamog.github.io/incontact-dashboard/redirect). Requires inContact login.
