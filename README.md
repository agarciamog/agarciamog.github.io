## About Me
As a professional, I enjoy tackling challenges and projects that apply software development in innovative and meaningful ways. During my tenure at inContact, Inc., I've had the opportunity to build applications that are scalable, incorporate redundancy, and leverage customers' APIs.

Outside of work, nothing beats traveling, backpacking, and eating good food.
